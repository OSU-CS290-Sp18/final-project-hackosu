HackOSU is a website for a Hackathon in the working for next Winter/Spring term of 2018 - 2019 year. It is the first step in proving to the College of Engineering and any other College that HackOSU may want the support of that this Hackathon is the real deal. Once a venue and a team is secured over the Summer of 2018 then an application to Major League Hacking will be sent out to become an official member event and we can begin looking for support from different organizations on and off campus as well as sponsors to make this event possible!

Back to the website, the current structure is using handlebars and express.js to create server-side code using JavaScript instead of PHP because no one wants that. I am using Bootstrap to style the website while adding my own CSS to customize it to my taste. Index handlebar uses mongodb to save applicants in the back-end while the Participants handlebar allows for an admin to view, update
